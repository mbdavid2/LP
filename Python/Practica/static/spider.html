        <p>
            The itsy bitsy spider<br/>
            Went up the water spout<br/>
            Down came the rain and<br/>
            Washed the spider out<br/>
            Out came the sun<br/>
            And dried up all the rain<br/>
            Now the itsy bitsy spider<br/>
            Went up the spout again<br/>
        </p>
